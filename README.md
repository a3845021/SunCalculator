# SunCalculator

 This is a small open source non-commercial project made with C++ on **[Cocos2dx](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x)** framework.

This app is one of the simplest sun angle (position) calculator. You can give it a specific time, day, month, and location and it calculates the sun azimuth and sun elevation for you.

This app uses *Solar Position Algorithm (SPA)* library developed by National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

No GPS permission or other is required. Everything is manually entered.



In order to run, clone this repo, then follow build tutorial on [Cocos2dx website](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/). Note that this app uses cocos2d-x-3.4 Jan.30 2015.
